/// borders; the first takes the reward from the second's fighters but does it on its own land" — nothing grand, but so the

/// (<see cref="BotParley.Judge"/>); what it is told is written here, from what the shard actually knows — each side's book of
/// grievances (<see cref="BotGrievances"/>), their opinions, their strength, their ground, their agreements and wars — and what
/// it may answer is an enumeration narrowed per topic (<see cref="Allowed"/>), so a duke cannot give an alliance to a pair that
