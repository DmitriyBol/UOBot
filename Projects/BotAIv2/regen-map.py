"""Rebuilds MAP.md's subsystem blocks and the whole of DIALS.md from this folder's own source.

Run from this directory:  python regen-map.py

Everything between the SECTION2 markers in MAP.md is replaced; nothing else is touched.

Each block is half generated and half kept here:

* generated from the code — the module class, the configuration file, the work the subsystem offers (every
  `IBotProposer` with the rung it offers on and the deeds it hands out), and the file table, whose row text is
  the first sentence of that file's own class summary;
* kept in BLOCKS below — the paragraph saying what the subsystem is for, and the traps worth knowing before
  touching it.

`regen-map.py` also reports drift in the subsystem READMEs rather than fixing it: those carry hand-written
reasoning that a generator has no business rewriting, but their file tables silently fall behind the folder
and that is how they came to say nine classes where there are thirteen. The check is a printed line, and
acting on it is a person's job.

DIALS.md is wholly generated: every `public static X Y { get; set; } = default;` in the assembly, with the
default it was written with and the configuration key that overrides it where one exists. It is kept out of
MAP.md so that the map stays cheap to read and a number stays one file away.

Written this way because the two halves rot differently. Anything derived from the code cannot drift, and the
prose is small enough to keep true by hand — which the subsystem READMEs, written once and left, are not: as
of 05.09.2026 several of them describe a shard that no longer exists.
