/// it came to per minute into the bot's ledger. What this comes to per minute is <em>nought</em> — always,
/// even when it succeeds, because it does not earn five hundred gold, it spends it. So the forecast decayed
/// towards <c>prior × 2 / (2 + tries)</c> and the errand poisoned itself: Bryn took it at 115 a minute on
/// 27.08.2026, was outbid by his own copper seam half a minute later, and thereafter it was offered to him
