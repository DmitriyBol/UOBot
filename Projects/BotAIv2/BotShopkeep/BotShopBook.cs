/// merchants, that buy what moves, store it, and carry it between towns. Such a bot needs to know three things per town and kind:
/// what bots there pay a shopkeeper for it (the demand a bot could have met and did not — the <c>Counter</c> columns), what bots'
/// shops there sold it for (the supply that exists and its price — the <c>Shop</c> columns), and where customers walked to a shop
/// and found it gone (<c>Missed</c>). This writes all three from the moment the first shop opens, so the merchant, when it comes,
/// starts from a measured book rather than a guess. Nothing reads it yet but the summary and the page.
