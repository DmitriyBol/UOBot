/// Plate, a blade, and spells anyway.

/// The one class that is defined by what it gives up. Meditation is how a caster gets mana back, and
/// the engine refuses it to anybody in metal — so a fighter who wanted to cast had to choose between
/// armour and being able to cast twice. This class chooses armour and is paid back with mana that
/// arrives on its own, in plate, in a fight, without sitting down.
///
/// Its trickle is worth the same as a mage's staff and does not stack with one: holding a mage's staff
/// buys it nothing. The advantage is not the quantity, it is that its hands are free for a sword while
/// it happens — and a mage that wants a sword has no answer to that at all.
///
/// It is the only class allowed two mana potions, for the same reason it is the only one with the
/// trickle: mana is what it runs out of, and the bottle is the only mana available to anybody who is
/// being hit.
