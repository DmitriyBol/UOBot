/// class's top three skills and nothing else, on purpose, because a population that begins at grandmaster
/// has nothing left to do and nothing to show a watcher. The captain is the exception the shard needs: it
/// cannot lead a company through ground that killed somebody while it is still learning which end of a bow
/// to hold, and it cannot teach a skill it does not have. So it arrives at Expert — see
/// <see cref="BotClass.Seasoned"/> — and that single fact is what buys it both of its offices.

/// <para>
/// <b>Both ranges, and the second one is not an apology.</b> <see cref="BotWarriorArcher"/> shoots and keeps
/// a dagger for when that stops working; the dagger is trained forty points below the bow and is, in its own
/// words, "an admission, not a second trade". The captain carries a broadsword at the same Expert standing
/// as its bow, and the difference shows in one moment: when something closes, an archer's whole case for
/// existing is that it is somewhere else, and a captain's is that it is exactly here. See
/// <see cref="Closes"/> — that flag is the class's entire combat identity, and everything else about the way
/// it fights is the shard's ordinary code.

/// there is no separate "teaching cap" constant to drift out of step with what the captain actually knows.
/// That is deliberate — a rule with two numbers on the same shelf is the defect this project keeps finding,
/// and the cheapest way not to have it is not to have the second number.
