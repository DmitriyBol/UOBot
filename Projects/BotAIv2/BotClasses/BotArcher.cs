/// The bow and nothing else, and the only class that can triple a hit.

/// No sidearm on purpose. Handing it a knife would make it a worse warrior-archer, and the interesting
/// thing about a pure archer is that closing with it is supposed to work — its answer to something in
/// its face is distance, which it has to earn every few seconds by stepping back and shooting again.
///
/// <para>
/// <b>The critical.</b> One shot in ten at grandmaster, one in thirty at birth, three times damage
/// when it lands. Scaled by Archery rather than granted whole because a talent handed out at birth is
/// not something a bot can work towards, and wanting to get better is the only motive this project
/// has — the same argument that makes a rank raise a target rather than satisfy it.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// It has to be visible to whatever decides whether a fight is winnable. Danger in this project is
/// toughness times damage, and an archer that quietly does more damage than its numbers say will keep
/// declining fights it would have won. That is a defect waiting in the decision layer, not here, and
/// it is written down so it is not discovered from a log.
