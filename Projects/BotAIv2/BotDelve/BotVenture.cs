/// enough for a dungeon's worst inhabitant walks to the cave mouth the gates know (<see cref="BotGates"/>), steps
/// through, and the errand is done: from there it is a bot at work underground like any other — the hunt offers it what

/// and when nothing is worth doing the walk home is offered and the journey takes it out by the mouth it came in by
