/// Who a guild's leader may put out and who it may take in, and how often.

/// <para>
/// <b>Patrick's order of 11.09.2026.</b> A guild could lose members and had no way to gain one: bots were
/// dealt in at birth, walked out of a guild that was getting nowhere, and nothing on the shard could ever
/// offer any of them a place again. On the evening this was written that had run to its conclusion — all
/// five guilds standing at one member each, seventy bots outside them, and the hall that would have made
/// the guilds worth staying in unraisable because raising one takes a levy on members nobody had.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>The power is the leader's, not the code's, and that is the point rather than an implementation
/// detail.</b> The five makers are the shard's thinking bots; they already charge their bands with a trade
/// to gather at and a trade to make at, through <see cref="BotCharter"/>, and this is the same kind of
/// power over the same band. What this file does is the part a model must not be asked to do: keep the
/// clock, rank the candidates, and refuse the moves that would turn a roster into a revolving door.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>One change per guild per <see cref="EveryMs"/>, and it may be both halves of one thought.</b> A
/// leader that could hire on every beat would empty the pool in a minute and a guild that could expel on
/// every beat would be a queue rather than a band. Expelling one and taking one in is a single act of
/// judgement, so it costs one turn of the clock, not two.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>What "productive" is measured by, and what it is not.</b> This shard keeps no per-bot ledger of
/// earnings — the ledger it has is per-place and per-trade — so the honest answer to "who is worth taking"
/// is <see cref="BotMobile.Progress"/>: the share of what its own class set out to learn that it has
/// actually reached. It is the population's own answer to whether a bot is becoming something, it cannot be
/// gamed by a bot that happens to be standing on a pile of gold, and it is the number the dashboard already
/// shows. The purse breaks ties, because a bot that has kept some is a bot whose work has been going
/// somewhere. If a per-bot earnings ledger is ever kept, this method is the one place that has to change.
