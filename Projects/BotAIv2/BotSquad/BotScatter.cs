/// <para>
/// <b>What it fixes.</b> A party sent to a hunting ground is sent to <em>one coordinate</em>, so it arrives
/// as a heap. Every bot in the heap sees the same eight tiles as every other, which means all but one of them
/// are contributing nothing — and the corner of the ground where the spawner is quietly refilling is watched
/// by nobody at all. Spawn timers on this shard run five to ten minutes, so a heap on an emptied graveyard is
/// a heap doing nothing for five minutes at a time. Spread over the same ground they cover it, and whatever
/// comes up comes up next to somebody.
/// </para>

/// <para>
/// <b>Why it is safe to spread out, which is the whole question.</b> Because being attacked is an event that
/// reaches the whole squad: one member hit sets the squad's focus and moves the anchor onto them, and every
/// station is derived from the anchor — so the knots re-form on the trouble without anybody calling for help
/// or deciding to answer. Spreading out is only a mistake in a world where nobody can hear a cry.

/// a lone bot: 53 health times nine damage plus thirty-one of magery. Two or three together are a party that
/// survives long enough for the rest to arrive. That is why the unit of scouting is a pair or a trio and not
/// a person.
