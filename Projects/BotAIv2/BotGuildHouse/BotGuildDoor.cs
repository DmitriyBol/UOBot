/// wipe — the reason <c>BotEstate.Unlock</c> opens every hall's doors for ever. It is also a wall to the planner:
/// <c>BotStep.BlockedByItems</c> counts a locked shut door as one for every bot, members included, so a locked guild house is
/// a house its own guild cannot walk home into. So the door is left unlocked in the engine's terms and refuses at the
/// handle instead: <see cref="Use"/> opens it for a member, for staff and for anybody already standing inside (nobody is
/// shut in), and says "That is locked" to everybody else, as the engine's own locked door does.
