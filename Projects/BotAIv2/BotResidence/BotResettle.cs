/// <b>The road is the traveller's own (<see cref="BotTravel"/>), held inside rather than copied.</b> The walk is drawn a leg
/// at a time over the graph, through a cave mouth when one is on the way; arriving walks the road in the book and tells the
/// guild what it read on the danger map, exactly as a journey for its own sake does. So a move is also a journey in the
/// travel line's counts, and the traveller's clock is stamped, so the bot is not offered a sightseeing trip the moment it
/// has unpacked.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>It lives there from the moment it sets out</b> (<see cref="Taken"/>), not from the moment it arrives. A bot that dies
/// on the road rises in its new town rather than walking the road twice; one that gives up on the road has its walk home
/// lead there. And the offer itself changes nothing: a bot that never takes the move lives where it did (DECISIONS C9).
/// </para>

/// <para>
/// <b>Unpaid, and priced like the walk home.</b> It is worth <see cref="Prior"/> a minute — above a journey's eight and the
/// walk home's five, below any trade — so it is what a bot does when nothing else is worth doing; and like the walk home it
/// declares the walk as the work, since the auction weighs an offer by the share of its time spent working and a move is
/// nothing but the walk.
