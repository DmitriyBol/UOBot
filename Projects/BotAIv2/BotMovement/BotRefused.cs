/// two thirds of every piece of work it started on errands that ended in "no way through": 20968 failures
/// out of 29666 undertakings in one session, 5103 of 5568 failures in another. Five destinations alone
/// accounted for 232 of them; herb gathering failed 2940 times out of 2990; a single scout errand failed 374
/// times out of 383. Each of those failures paid for a full path search first — 43139 searches, 1.6 billion
/// tiles, 588 seconds of the game loop in under two hours.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>And none of it was written down anywhere a chooser could read.</b> The shard already had three records
/// about ground and not one of them fit: <see cref="BotReach"/> learns pockets, but only ones small enough
/// to walk the edges of — a patch of grass across water is part of the mainland, the probe returns TooBig,
/// and nothing is filed (five pockets learned in four hours). <see cref="BotQuad"/>'s baulks are shaped like
/// quadrants, thirty tiles across, and until this same night only the hunt read them. And
/// <see cref="BotLedger"/>'s caution is per-bot, so forty-nine bots each discover the same wall separately.

/// and when. The rest doubles with each refusal up to a ceiling, so a place that turned one bot away on a
/// bad afternoon is tried again in minutes, while a rooftop that has turned away nine is left alone for
/// hours. <b>And arriving anywhere clears it</b> — which is the property the baulk map lacked, and the
