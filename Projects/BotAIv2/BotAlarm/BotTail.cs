/// <summary>
/// Counts the errors the shard is printing, by reading the tail of its own session log.
///
/// <para>
/// <b>Why the shard reads its own log rather than being told.</b> Errors here go through Serilog, configured
/// once in <c>Projects/Logger</c> with a single console sink, and this fork's first rule is that the engine
/// is not modified — so there is no seam to subscribe to. Every error every subsystem raises, and every one
/// the engine itself raises, is nonetheless already written to one file. Reading it is the only way to have
/// them all without touching what is not ours.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>What is taken from it is a number, never a retelling.</b> The channel gets "26 errors in the last
/// minute" plus one specimen line, not a copy of the log — the log is already the place to read errors, and
/// an alarm channel that reprints it would be a second, slower copy of the thing it is supposed to point at.
/// The rule this shard learned the hard way is to listen to the shard's own sentences rather than to a
/// re-derivation of them, and a count of a line the shard wrote is the smallest possible re-derivation.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>The level sits outside the bracket: <c>[19:57:35 ERR]</c>.</b> A pattern of <c>[ERR</c> matches nothing
/// and reports a clean run for ever — which it did, for a whole evening, through twenty-six real errors. The
/// needle here is <c>" ERR]"</c>, with the space, and it is a constant rather than a setting for that reason.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>Two honest limits, both named in what it reports.</b> The file is written through a redirect and
/// arrives in buffers, so a count for "the last minute" can be a minute or so behind the world — fine for
/// noticing, useless for timing. And reading starts at the end of the file: errors already in it when the
/// shard came up belong to a previous life, and counting them at the first tick would open every session
/// with an alarm about the last one.
