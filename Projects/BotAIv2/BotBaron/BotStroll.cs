/// prices unfalsifiable and left the Baron's mind with a menu of exactly one item every time it was asked.
/// A mind with one option is not thinking; it is being told. Offered together, there is a real question in
/// front of him — go now with the five who happen to be standing here, or walk and be asked again in four
/// minutes — and the arithmetic answers it by default while the mind is allowed to disagree and be measured.
