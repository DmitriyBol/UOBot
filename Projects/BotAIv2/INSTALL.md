# BotAI — installation

Autonomous bots for [ModernUO](https://github.com/modernuo/ModernUO). Two assemblies, and the second one is
optional:

| | |
|---|---|
| **BotAIv2** | the population: trades, combat, market, squads, guilds, halls, land, wars, dungeons, crime and the law, errands, the quadrant map. No external dependencies. |
| **BotMindAI** | `mindedBots/` — Argus's squad of observers, and optional thinking crafters that choose with a local LLM instead of pure arithmetic. Needs [Ollama](https://ollama.com) to think; builds and runs without it. |

`BotMindAI` references `BotAIv2` and never the other way round. You can ship the first without the second; you
cannot ship the second alone.

> **Four engine patches are required**, all in `engine-patches/`. From the root of the ModernUO checkout, before
> building:
>
> ```bash
> git apply Projects/BotAIv2/engine-patches/*.patch
> ```
>
> - `CraftItem-heat-source.patch` adds two accessors to `Projects/UOContent/Engines/Craft/Core/CraftItem.cs`,
>   exposing two questions the engine already answers privately — is this tile a fire, is this mobile standing near
>   one.
> - `CraftItem-said.patch` adds one event to the same file, raised wherever the craft system tells the crafter
>   something, so a bot can hear why an attempt produced nothing.
> - `HarvestDefinition-said.patch` adds one event to `Projects/UOContent/Engines/Harvest/Core/HarvestDefinition.cs`,
>   raised where the harvest system sends a player its message, so a bot can hear why a swing produced nothing.
> - `Titles-skill-title.patch` adds an overload to `Projects/UOContent/Misc/Titles.cs` that titles a mobile by a skill
>   the caller chooses, so a bot is ranked by what it earned rather than by what every bot is handed.
>
> Without them `BotAIv2` does not compile. Nothing in the engine subscribes to the two events, every message is
> still sent exactly as before, and the old `GetSkillTitle` answers exactly as it did. Each file explains itself
> above its diff; `git apply` skips that text. The diffs need LF line endings, which this repository's
> `.gitattributes` keeps on every checkout.

## Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| Server | ModernUO at `be3a085` (newer ModernUO uses 4.x serialization packages, which `BotAIv2` does not build against yet), .NET 10 SDK |
| **Expansion** | **Renaissance (UOR)** — `"core.expansion": "UOR"` in `Distribution/Configuration/modernuo.json` |
| Client | any UO client ModernUO supports; ClassicUO was used throughout |
| Ollama | only for the thinking bots and the observers — see below |

The era matters. Every weapon, spell circle, armour rating and crafting recipe the bots reason about is read off the
shard's own tables for **this** expansion. On a later expansion the code still builds and the numbers stop meaning
what they say.

---

## 1. Ordinary bots

**Copy the projects**

```
Projects/BotAIv2/                 → your ModernUO checkout, same place
```

**Add them to the solution** (`ModernUO.slnx`):

```xml
<Project Path="Projects/BotAIv2/BotAIv2.csproj" />
<Project Path="Projects/BotAIv2/mindedBots/BotMindAI.csproj" />
```

**Load them** — `Distribution/Data/assemblies.json`:

```json
[
  "UOContent.dll",
  "BotAIv2.dll",
  "BotMindAI.dll"
]
```

**The switches** — `Distribution/Configuration/modernuo.json`. Every one defaults to `"True"` and is written there
at first boot: `"bots.enabled"` for the whole thing, then one per module, there to switch one off while diagnosing:

```
bots.alarm.enabled      bots.auction.enabled    bots.baron.enabled      bots.classes.enabled
bots.craft.enabled      bots.dashboard.enabled  bots.debugger.enabled   bots.delve.enabled
bots.drill.enabled      bots.estate.enabled     bots.harvest.enabled    bots.hunt.enabled
bots.mend.enabled       bots.mind.enabled       bots.movement.enabled   bots.population.enabled
bots.quests.enabled     bots.shops.enabled      bots.spells.enabled     bots.squads.enabled
bots.will.enabled       bots.mind.thinking
```

**Copy the configuration** — `Distribution/Configuration/bot-*.json`. Every file is optional: leave one out and the
code's own defaults apply, and the file writes itself on first boot.

**Build and run**

```bash
dotnet build ModernUO.slnx -c Release
cd Distribution
dotnet ModernUO.dll
```

The first start asks where the client files are, which expansion — `UOR` — and for the owner account, so it has to
be run from a real console; on Windows that is PowerShell or cmd, not the Git Bash window. After that
`./start-shard-detached.ps1` starts it detached. The shard raises the population on start. Confirm it in the log:

```
Population raised: 80 bots at (1440, 1470, 0) on Felucca
```

**Give them a world.** A fresh ModernUO world is bare. As the owner, in game: `[Decorate`, then
`[ImportSpawners Data/Spawns/shared/felucca/*.json`, then `[Save` and `[Restart`. The bots find shops, forges,
fires and creatures by surveying the ground as they go, and a survey is kept for the rest of the session, so the
restart is what makes them look again at a world that now has something in it.

**Where to start tuning** — `Distribution/Configuration/bot-population.json`:

```json
{
  "Map": "Felucca",
  "Home": [1440, 1470, 0],
  "Purse": 400,
  "Run": true,
  "Roam": 1000,
  "Classes": { "Warrior": 15, "Archer": 13, "Gatherer": 12, "Mage": 10, "WarriorMage": 8, "WarriorArcher": 8,
               "Crafter": 5, "Healer": 4, "Brawler": 1, "Captain": 1, "Baron": 1, "Architect": 1, "Sage": 1 }
}
```

`Classes` is the whole population: names come from the classes in `BotClasses/`, counts are yours. `Home` is where a
bot with no guild lives; a bot in a guild is born and raised again at its guild's seat.

> Config keys are **PascalCase**. A lower-case key is silently ignored and the default applies, with nothing in the
> log to say so.

**In game** — `[bots` opens the dashboard (administrator only), eleven tabs.

**Stopping** — write `do save` into `Distribution/argus-in.txt`, wait for the answer in `argus-out.txt`, then
`taskkill /F /IM ModernUO.exe`. A kill without the save rolls the world back to the last autosave.

---

## 2. The observers and thinking crafters (Ollama)

Optional. The rest of the population is untouched either way, and if Ollama is not running the shard **does not
fail** — the minds log that they could not reach the model, the observers go on measuring, and every bot decides by
arithmetic like everybody else.

**Install Ollama and pull the models**

```bash
ollama pull deepseek-r1:14b
ollama pull qwen3.5:9b
```

The first is the observers' model. The second is the crafters', chosen for latency, and needed only if crafters
are to think.

**The observers** — on by default (`"bots.debugger.enabled"`), and optionally configured in
`Distribution/Configuration/bot-debugger.json`: the helpers' names, their robes and the thresholds. In game,
`[argus` takes you to the lead observer and `[argus here` brings it to you; from the keyboard, write a line into
`Distribution/argus-in.txt`.

**The thinking crafters** — off by default: no crafter has thought since 18.09.2026. Which crafters think is a list
of names in `Distribution/Configuration/bot-mind.json`:

```json
{
  "Model": "qwen3.5:9b",
  "Endpoint": "http://127.0.0.1:11434",
  "CrafterNames": ["Roderic", "Emeric", "Ulric", "Wulfric"]
}
```

Each name is a mind that claims a crafter and renames it, so keep at least as many crafters in
`bot-population.json` as there are names. Without Ollama nothing breaks: the calls fail and those crafters choose by
arithmetic. `bot-minds.json` holds the rules each mind has written for itself; the shard writes it.

---

## Notes for a fork

- **`mindedBots/` is nested but is not part of `BotAIv2`.** `BotAIv2.csproj` excludes it explicitly
  (`<Compile Remove="mindedBots\**" />`). Without that exclusion an SDK project would compile those files into
  `BotAIv2`, and since `BotMindAI` references `BotAIv2`, the build would refuse the cycle.
- **The bots live in the world save**, like any character: a restart brings each one back where it stood, with its
  pack and its bank. Do not delete the world save — it holds real characters too.
- **Eleven stores are written beside it under `Distribution/Saves/`**: `BotProgress` (what each bot learned, by
  name), `BotCommons` (what each trade pays where), `BotQuads` (what the population found out about the island),
  `BotClaims` (who owns which square), `BotSeats` (where each guild lives), `BotChests` (the guilds' chests),
  `BotWars` (wars, truces, clocks and the guilds' opinions of each other), `BotCity` (the city's standing orders and
  bounties), `BotQuests` (the board of errands), `BotOutlaws` (the murderers and the cells) and `BotUnderworld` (the
  criminal record and The Shadow). Deleting one resets that and nothing else.
- **A running shard holds the assemblies.** Building `BotAIv2` while it runs still reports compile errors; building
  anything under `mindedBots/` does not, because MSBuild skips it once its dependency's copy has failed. Stop the
  shard before trusting that build.
- **Everything is measured in the log.** Each subsystem prints a line naming every refusal separately. If something
  is not happening, the reason is usually already written down.
