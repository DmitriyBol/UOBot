/// and a look at whether they went. No blow is struck here at any standing — striking is what a war is for,
/// and a war is declared by <see cref="BotRegard"/> out of what these errands find, never inside one of
/// them. Patrick's plan says eviction is rare and the measure that says it has gone wrong is the completion
/// band falling while evictions rise; an errand that could kill would make that measure impossible to read.

/// <para>
/// <b>The refusal is the point rather than the going.</b> A bot told to move along does not obey — nothing
/// on this shard obeys anybody — so what actually happens is that the guild learns something: they were
/// asked, and they are still there. That is what moves the opinion, and it is why the errand waits a few
/// seconds after speaking before looking again. Somebody who has wandered off in that time is not defying
/// anybody, and counting them as though they had would be a war built out of ordinary walking.
