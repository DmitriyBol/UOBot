/// This was written leader-only at first, on the reasoning that one bot cannot race itself — and it was a
/// veto wearing a preference's clothes. The Crown could pay for a hall from its first minute and never
/// bought one: its leader is the Captain, the Captain joins a company, and a bot on the <c>Bound</c> rung
/// has its auction switched off entirely. Six minutes of a running shard with 32 bots busy, 17 bound and
/// none free went by with the money in hand and nobody able to be offered the work. A guild of two whose
/// leader is in a company is a guild that can never build anything.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// So the offer goes to whoever of the guild is choosing work, and the claim below keeps it to one at a
/// time: a claim expires by the clock rather than by an event, because the bot holding it may die, drop
/// the errand or be taken into a company, and none of those three sends anybody a message.

/// <para>
/// <b>What it can afford is asked here rather than in the work.</b> An undertaking that says it needs five
/// thousand gold makes its bot feel destitute — <c>BotDeed.Outlay</c> is what poverty is measured against —
/// and the money is not the bot's anyway. So the affordability test lives on this side of the offer, where
/// it costs the bot nothing to fail.
