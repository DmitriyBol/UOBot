///
/// <para>
/// <b>It asks no model anything, and that is the first decision here.</b> The three questions — did it get
/// where it was going, did it finish what it took on, did anything change at all — are arithmetic. A model
/// is worth asking why a bot is stuck; it is not worth asking whether one is, and a check that depends on a
/// model is a check that does not run while the card is busy. This runs on a two-minute clock whatever else
/// is happening, costs one pass over the roll, and cannot fail to fire.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>It is also the point at which the debugger stops being only an observer, and that is worth saying out
/// loud.</b> Everything else in this folder was built so the watcher could not affect what it watched. From
/// here it can: it clears a stale route, and if that does not help it ends the piece of work. So every
/// intervention is written down with what was true before it and what was true two minutes after, and the
/// counts are reported separately from everything else. An intervention nobody measures is not a fix, it is
/// a second source of behaviour nobody can account for — and this shard already knows what that costs.
/// </para>

/// keeps the destination: the bot still wants the same thing and draws a fresh path to it, which is the
/// whole cure when the plan has gone stale under it. A shake ends the undertaking as a failure, so the
/// ledger learns that place was no good and the auction offers something else. The first is cheap and
/// reversible and is tried first; the second throws away work in hand and is only for a bot that was
