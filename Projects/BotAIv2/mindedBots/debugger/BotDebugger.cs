/// <b>It is not a <c>BotMobile</c>, and that is the first decision here rather than an implementation
/// detail.</b> Everything the population does to a bot — the clock, the auction, the ladder, the urges, the
/// kit, the revival — is keyed on that type. A debugger derived from it would be raised, outfitted, asked
/// what it wanted to do, counted in every census, and would appear in its own reports as one of the
/// subjects. An observer that shows up in its own measurements is not an observer. So this derives from
/// <see cref="PlayerMobile"/> directly, nothing in BotAIv2 has any way to reach it, and every count it
/// takes is a count of the population and not of the population plus itself.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>Invisible to everybody but an administrator, and it is the engine's own rule doing it.</b>
/// <c>Mobile.CanSee(Mobile)</c> lets a hidden mobile through only for a viewer whose access level is above
/// Player <em>and</em> at least the hidden one's own. Setting this body to
/// <see cref="AccessLevel.Administrator"/> therefore hides it from every player and from every counsellor,
/// game master and seer as well; the owner's own character sees it because Owner outranks Administrator.
/// Nothing here filters packets or overrides visibility, which matters: a hand-written rule would be a
/// second opinion about who sees what, and the two would disagree the first time the engine changed.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>And the same two flags are what keep it from disturbing the very thing it is watching.</b>
/// <c>CanMoveOver</c> in the fork's own movement implementation passes a mobile that is hidden and above
/// Player, so a bot never has to path around this one and can walk straight through the tile it is standing
/// on. That is not a nicety — an observer that blocks a doorway would manufacture the stalls it is here to
/// find, and every finding after that would be about itself. <see cref="PlayerMobile.OnAccessLevelChanged"/>
/// sets <c>IgnoreMobiles</c> from the same access level, which closes the other direction.
