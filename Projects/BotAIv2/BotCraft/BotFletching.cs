/// <summary>
/// What a fletcher needs to know: the craft system, the tool, and the two-step chain that turns a log and a
/// feather into an arrow.
///
/// <para>
/// <b>Why this trade exists at all.</b> Arrows were the only consumable on this shard with no source. The
/// population is born with a hundred and fifty apiece and thirteen bots shoot them; the provisioner keeps
/// twenty at a time and the variety dealer thirty to sixty; gleaning brings back one or two off the ground
/// and the rest break. So the arrow supply could only ever fall, and on the morning of 04.09.2026 it hit
/// bottom: five archers failed sixty-seven fights in ten minutes, every one of them reading "100% of it left
/// and not a scratch in 45s" — a bow being swung with nothing in it. The blade in the pack (see
/// <c>BotArms.Quiver</c>) is what stops that being a dead bot; this is what stops it happening.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>Two steps and no station, which is what makes this the shortest craft on the shard.</b> A smith needs
/// a forge with an anvil beside it and a miner to bring it metal. Fletching needs a tool in the pack and
/// nothing else: <c>Log → Shaft</c>, then <c>Shaft + Feather → Arrow</c>, both at Fletching 0–40, which is
/// to say anybody who owns the tool can do it. And every recipe in the chain is <c>SetUseAllRes</c>, so one
/// action spends everything the pack holds — a hundred logs become a hundred shafts in a single swing.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>Where the two materials come from is the whole point of the trade.</b> Logs are sold by carpenters, so
/// they are money. Feathers are sold by <em>nobody</em> — there is not one <c>typeof(Feather)</c> in any
/// vendor's stock on this shard — and come off birds, twenty-five to a chicken and thirty-six to an eagle,
/// which the hunters kill all day and list on the population's own market. So the arrow is the first thing
/// on this island that cannot be made without something another bot went out and killed.
